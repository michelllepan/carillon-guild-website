During the fall and spring semesters, our recital schedule is:

- Monday through Saturday: 10-minute recitals at 7:50am, 12pm, and 6pm
- Sunday: 45-minute recital at 2pm (programs available at the front of Sather Tower)

Recitals are subject to carillonist availability; feel free to contact calbells@gmail.com with questions about specific recitals! 
We sometimes organize themed recitals, which we post about on our Instagram [@ucbells](https://www.instagram.com/ucbells/).

You may also hear the bells ring on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings throughout the school year as they are used for practice and instruction.

During the summer, we occasionally play at the times listed above but do not follow a regular schedule.
