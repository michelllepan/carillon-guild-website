Welcome to the website of the Berkeley Carillon Guild! Get started by learning about [the carillon](/about), [the guild](/guild), or [how you can get involved](/playing).

Concerts are at 7:50am, noon, and 6pm for 10 minutes from Monday to Friday. We also play a 10 minute noon concert on Saturdays and an hour-long recital on Sundays at 2pm, with programs available in front of Sather Tower for the latter.
