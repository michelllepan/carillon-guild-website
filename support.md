The Berkeley Carillon Guild is a student organization at a cash-strapped public university. We spend our limited funds on carillon enrichment, which usually covers the bare essentials: paper and ink, earplugs, and some new music. Most tours and special concerts involve out-of-pocket expense.

Your donation funds both our carillon events and improvements of recording and practice equipment. Items that would improve our space:

* an old computer
* printer
* copy machine
* additional metronomes
* an external hard drive
* recording equipment for the tower

We also are receptive to donations funding:

* a Carillon Concert Series at Berkeley
* a student tour of other carillons
* a large renovation of the instrument (expected when we have the funds)

If you wish to donate one of the above items, or contribute some other way, please contact us at calbells@gmail.com. We sincerely appreciate your support.
