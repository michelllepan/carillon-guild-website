The Berkeley Carillon Guild is a student group of UC Berkeley. We are the carillon students of Jeff Davis, University Carillonist.

This organization enables us to purchase music, organize special carillon concerts in Berkeley, and tour and perform at other carillons. We focus on writing and performing high-quality music for the instrument. We hope to raise general awareness about carillon through a student-run class (called a "DeCal") on the bells.
