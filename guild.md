The Berkeley Carillon Guild is a student group of UC Berkeley. We are the carillon students of [Simone Browne](https://simone-browne.com/about/), Interim University Carillonist.

This organization enables us to purchase music, organize special carillon concerts in Berkeley, and tour and perform at other carillons. We focus on writing and performing high-quality music for the instrument. We hope to raise general awareness about carillon through a student-run class (called a "DeCal") on the bells.
