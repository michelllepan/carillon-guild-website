We will be hosting the 10th Berkeley Carillon Festival on June 29-30, 2024! This year's festival is in honor of the retirement of our University Carillonist, Jeff Davis.

We'll be playing four one-hour recitals over the weekend, at noon and 2pm each day. Bring your friends, family, and a picnic blanket to listen! Programs will be available outside the tower.
